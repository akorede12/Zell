**HOW IT WORKS**
**TL:DR**
**Sellers create NFTs on Zell that ristrict access to the links of their exclusive products sales page, created NFTs go on sale on Zell's store front, buyers that purchase these NFTs are given access to the sales page of the special products, buyers with the NFT will be allowed to purchase the exclusive products.**

Seller creates NFT collection (No need to worry about gas fees).

Seller fills in the information of the NFT;
Uploads NFT image,
Provide a description for NFT collection, 
States the number of NFTs to be created
States the price of each NFTs.

The NFTs provide an ability to gate links.

The seller is asked to provide the weblink for the sale, that is to be restricted. 

A new link is generated and given to the seller. The newly generate link should be used in place of the original link for the product sale.

Users with the required NFTs have the ability to access the gated link of the sale. 

Users without the NFT cannot. 

After creation the NFTs are put for sale on the Zell Store front, for interested buyers.
